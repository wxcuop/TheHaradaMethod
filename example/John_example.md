An Example: John Follows the Harada Method
Regardless of their level of difficulty, goals can be achieved by following the Harada method. The following example looks at a goal set by an information technology (IT) services employee, John. He is a programmer and codes programs. The mission of his company is to ensure that its customers receive quality code in the fastest time possible.

John was given feedback that his code quality is not up to the mark (i.e., there are more than five defects per thousand lines of code). Further, his productivity is also not at the level it should be. After completing the 33 questions, John knows that he needs to improve four descriptors: knowledge, skilled work, time management, and independence.

With this in mind, he developed a long-term goal: To be the fastest, most accurate programmer in the company. Additionally, John discussed this goal with his team leader who has agreed this is a good goal and has agreed to help and guide John in his endeavor.

Next, John completes the long-term goal sheet 
Based on his long-term goal sheet, John created an open window 64 chart. 
Following the Routine
John then identified five tasks for his routine check sheet 


John uses a one to denote that he performed the activity on the given date; zero denotes that he did not complete the activity. Individuals should use any marks that work best for them, such as checkmarks. He also created a daily diary to support this check sheet. A sample day is shown in Table 2.

Solid Results
Following this routine, John moved toward his goal. As shown in the check sheet, he was distracted along the way. Subsequently, he had some late nights that led to late mornings that affected his accuracy and productivity.


However, with the help of the Harada method, John was able to achieve his goal. He can spend more time with his family and his superiors are happy with his performance. Further, his performance appraisal reflected this success – he is being considered for an assignment with a prestigious customer.
