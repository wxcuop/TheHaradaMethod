**Kaizen style** refers to a working and thinking approach based on **continuous, incremental improvement**, widely used in Lean, manufacturing, operations, leadership, and personal development.

Here’s a clear breakdown:

# ⭐ What “Kaizen Style” Means

## 1. **Continuous Improvement**

Instead of making big, disruptive changes, Kaizen focuses on making **small improvements every day**.
These changes compound over time into major improvements.

## 2. **Everyone Participates**

Kaizen is not top-down.
It encourages **all employees and team members**—from executives to front-line workers—to look for ways to improve processes, tools, and habits.

## 3. **Eliminate Waste (Muda)**

Kaizen seeks to remove:

* wasted time
* unnecessary movement
* defects or rework
* excess inventory
* overcomplication
* bottlenecks

This comes from the Toyota Production System.

## 4. **Solve the Root Cause**

Instead of patching symptoms, Kaizen applies:

* **5 Whys**
* **Gemba walks** (go see the real place)
* **A3 thinking**

to understand and eliminate root issues.

## 5. **Iterative Cycles**

Kaizen uses **PDCA**:

**P**lan → **D**o → **C**heck → **A**ct

Each cycle should lead to a slightly better system.

# 🌱 Personal Kaizen

Used in self-development, Kaizen means improving yourself a little bit every day:

* If 1% better per day → ~37× better after a year.
* Build habits, routines, and systems gradually.
* Reduce friction and waste in your daily life.

This connects directly to the **Harada Method**, where the structure (1–8–64) and daily routines are very Kaizen-aligned.

# 🧪 Kaizen Style Examples

### Workplace

* Reduce the number of steps in a workflow.
* Rearrange a workspace to reduce movement.
* Standardize a process to reduce variation.

### Personal Development

* Write 10 minutes daily instead of trying to write a whole book at once.
* Add one new routine per week.
* Improve your diet by removing one unhealthy habit at a time.

# 🧭 In Summary

**Kaizen style = small, continuous improvements that everyone contributes to, guided by root-cause problem-solving and iterative learning.**
