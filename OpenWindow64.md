Open Window 64 Chart
This form takes the goal sheet to the next level. It is a specific framework that helps individuals develop 64 mini-tasks and routines to support the goal defined on the long-term goal sheet.

This chart consists of 81 boxes. At the center is the ultimate goal; it is surrounded by eight smaller tasks that the individual believes are required to support the central goal. Next, for each of those eight smaller tasks, identify eight even smaller goals.

Then there will be 64 steps that need to be followed and finished to achieve the ultimate goal. Those 64 steps form the name of this template – the open window 64 chart. (In the example below, Figure 5 illustrates the first nine windows of this chart.)
