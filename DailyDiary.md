Daily Diary
The daily diary is similar to a typical to-do list. It helps plan individuals’ days to help meet the ultimate goal. At the end of each day, the individual can see what was accomplished and what still needs work. In essence, the daily diary is a tool to help keep track of the routine check sheet that was already created.
