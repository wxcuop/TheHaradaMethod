# Key Principles of the Harada Method

## 1. Self-Reliance as the Foundation for Continuous Improvement

The essence of the Harada method is self-reliance.  This principle emphasizes that individuals should improve themselves so significantly that success becomes a natural consequence. 

### Self-Reliance Defined
Self-reliance is the confidence and ability of individuals to develop their skills to the extent that they become virtually irreplaceable. Self-reliant people take full responsibility for their personal and professional growth.

### Methodical Execution
The methodology converts ambitious, long-term visions into a comprehensive, measurable system of daily action, notably through the Open Window 64 (OW64) chart.  This structure transforms strategic goals into actionable daily tasks.

## 2. Holistic Individual Development (Hitozukuri)

The Harada Method focuses on the development and formation of people, a concept known as **hitozukuri**. This is seen as the way to achieve **monozukuri** (excellence in manufacturing and continuous improvement).

### Continuous Maturation
Hitozukuri is a continuous process that allows people to mature along with their work, master current jobs, learn new skills, and find new ways to improve existing processes.

### The Four Pillars of Improvement
Continuous personal improvement and self-reliance rely on harmonizing four aspects of the individual's life:
- **Spirit** - Mental attitude and motivation
- **Skill** - Competence and expertise
- **Physical Conditions** - Health and energy
- **Daily Life** - Habits and routines

### Habit Formation
The pursuit of continuous improvement is built on the belief that repeating positive habits consciously transforms into creating powerful skills for subconscious success.  Self-reliance grows through deliberate practice and consistent action.

## 3. Mastery of Skills and Disciplined Action

The system is built on the belief that success itself is a skill that can be attained through making an effort. 

### Mastery Over Mediocrity
Individuals must strive to master the skill they are working on, whether it is data entry or complicated machinery work, and then continually better that skill.

### Systematic Preparation
Success comes from setting measurable, quantifiable goals that one truly believes in and meticulously executing a detailed plan. Professionals prepare thoroughly for action before implementation.

### Daily Routines and Reflection
The method emphasizes continuous feedback through specific tools, such as the Routine Check Sheet and the Daily Diary. Keeping a diary facilitates reflection, which is essential for identifying improvement opportunities.

## 4.  Integration with Organizational Improvement

The philosophical goal of individual self-reliance is to directly facilitate a company's process improvement journey.

### Addressing the Eighth Waste
The Harada Method serves as the "Human Side of Lean". It directly addresses and helps eliminate the "Eighth Waste" of Lean, which is the underutilized skills, knowledge, and potential of employees.

### Goals Beyond the Self (Selfless Service)
A key principle is that true success and a successful self-reliant person must realize the importance of setting goals and purposes that extend beyond personal achievement.  This creates a culture of continuous improvement that benefits the entire organization.

## Conclusion

The Harada Method, by prioritizing individual accountability, detailed planning, and the acquisition of positive daily habits, treats continuous improvement less like a spontaneous event and more like a disciplined, systemized approach to personal and organizational excellence.
