The key principles are:
1. Self-Reliance as the Foundation for Continuous Improvement
The essence of the Harada method is self-reliance. This principle emphasizes that individuals should improve themselves so significantly that success becomes a natural consequence.
• Self-Reliance Defined: Self-reliance is the confidence and ability of individuals to develop their skills to the extent that they become virtually irreplaceable. Self-reliant people take full responsibility for their goals and see failure not as a chance to blame others, but as an opportunity for improvement.
• Methodical Execution: The methodology converts ambitious, long-term visions into a comprehensive, measurable system of daily action, notably through the Open Window 64 (OW64) chart. This structured approach is fundamental to long-term self-improvement.
2. Holistic Individual Development (Hitozukuri)
The Harada Method focuses on the development and formation of people, a concept known as hitozukuri. This is seen as the way to achieve monozukuri (excellence in manufacturing and continuous improvement).
• Continuous Maturation: Hitozukuri is a continuous process that allows people to mature along with their work, master current jobs, learn new skills, and find new ways to improve existing processes.
• The Four Pillars of Improvement: Continuous personal improvement and self-reliance rely on harmonizing four aspects of the individual's life: spirit, skill, physical conditions, and daily life.
• Habit Formation: The pursuit of continuous improvement is built on the belief that repeating positive habits consciously transforms into creating powerful skills for subconscious success. Self-reliant people prioritize creating new habits aligned with their goals.
3. Mastery of Skills and Disciplined Action
The system is built on the belief that success itself is a skill that can be attained through making an effort.
• Mastery Over Mediocrity: Individuals must strive to master the skill they are working on, whether it is data entry or complicated machinery work, and then continually better that skill.
• Systematic Preparation: Success comes from setting measurable, quantifiable goals that one truly believes in and meticulously executing a detailed plan. Professionals prepare thoroughly for action, contrasting with amateurs who act pessimistically because they don't prepare well. The preparation level is considered the best predictor of results.
• Daily Routines and Reflection: The method emphasizes continuous feedback through specific tools, such as the Routine Check Sheet and the Daily Diary. Keeping a diary facilitates reflection, which in turn helps an individual check progress, learn from mistakes, and develop deep self-insight, functioning as a form of self-coaching.
4. Integration with Organizational Improvement
The philosophical goal of individual self-reliance is to directly facilitate a company's process improvement journey.
• Addressing the Eighth Waste: The Harada Method serves as the "Human Side of Lean". It directly addresses and helps eliminate the "Eighth Waste" of Lean, which is the underutilized skills, knowledge, and talent of people.
• Goals Beyond the Self (Selfless Service): A key principle is that true success and a successful self-reliant person must realize the importance of setting goals and purposes that extend beyond personal gain. This means striving to make both tangible and intangible goals come true for oneself and for society and others. The value of work lies in achieving happiness not just for oneself, but for others and society.
The Harada Method, by prioritizing individual accountability, detailed planning, and the acquisition of positive daily habits, treats continuous improvement less like a spontaneous event and more like the inevitable outcome of a diligently maintained machine, where the individual is the central, self-optimizing engine.
